# Lines

Lines is a minimalistic Hugo blogging theme. This is a fairly modified fork of the original theme (see below) to make it more in line with what I wanted at [tinytech.blog](https://tinytech.blog).

## Based on ronv/lines

The original theme can be [found here (github/ronv/lines)](https://github.com/ronv/lines).
